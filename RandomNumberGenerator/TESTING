TESTING for weather.c

First, I tested entering no arguments.
As expected, the program exits and asks for only one argument.
Additionally, if you enter more than one argument, it again
asks for only one argument.

Next, I tested arguments longer or shorter than four
characters. The program asks for an argument that is exactly
four characters.

Next, I tested the program with invalid codes.
The program returns that the code is invalid

Next, I modified my code and asked it to search for a tag
that doesn't exist. The program printed all other relevant
information, and noted that the tag couldn't be found.
