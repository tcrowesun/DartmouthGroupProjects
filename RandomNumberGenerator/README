How to build and run programs, contents of this repository and
other general information

Platform Used
-------------
Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) running on a 2012 MacBook Pro

Building Submission
-------------------
Our project will compile automatically with the make utility using the
included Makefile. The `make` command will compile the entire
submission, creating weatherrandom and extender executables in the
current directory. `make testing` creates a badRNG executable for
testing purposes, while `make indexer` creates a findstations executable
in case the user wants to recreate the index. `make weather` creates
a weather executable in case the user wishes to examine the program
from which we created weatherrandom.c.

`make clean` will remove all executables, .o files, and so on, restoring
all directories and subdirectories to their pre-make state.

Running the included shell script (./generaterand.sh) with the
appropriate parameters will create an output file of random bytes according
to user specifications. The expected input to the script is as follows:

./generaterand.sh [OUTPUT FILE NAME] [NUMBER OF SEED INTS] [NUMBER OF OUTPUT 
BYTES]

Where [OUTPUT FILE NAME] is the desired output file (comes from the extender),
[NUMBER OF SEED INTS] is the number of random integers/bit patterns created by
weatherrandom.c, and [NUMBER OF OUTPUT BYTES] is the number of bytes written
to the output file by the extender.

Notes
-----
Much of our testing is described in the accompanying essay; the TESTING file
contains information left over from weather.c (a program created as part of CS
50, Software Design and Implementation). The TESTING file will be updated as
necessary at a later date.

Please contact Matt, Tyler, or Chris with any further questions. Thanks for
using our random number generator!
